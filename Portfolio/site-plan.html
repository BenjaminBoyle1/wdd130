        Looking for my next opportunity to make a change. The digital way.

        About me:
        Hello everyone and welcome to my portfolio! I am from Las Vegas, Nevada and I am 22 years old. I served a mission for
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Honduras from 2018-2020. Because of that opportunity I am fluent in
        English and Spanish. Since returning home I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I love all things related
        to computers. I built my first PC when I was 15 and have since build over 200. I would love the opportunity to help you 
        with any software engineering needs you may have!

      </ul>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        Education:
        I graduated from Coronado Highschool in 2018 with a 4.0 gpa. I was the president of Computer Science club and it was in Highschool
        that I discovered my love for computers. I began taking Coding Academy classes and mainly focused on Java. After graduating I immediately left on my mission to Honduras. 
        After returning home at the end of 2020 I began my studies at Brigham Young University Idaho. I am majoring in Computer Science
        with a minor in Spanish. Whenever something interests me I hyperfixate on learning everything I can and becoming the best I can 
        possibly be. This is especially true with programming. Since beginning my studies I have taken countless online courses to give 
        me an advantage in my courses and to be able to start working as I further my education. In addition, I am preparing for an internship
        this summer with LinkedIn, where I will be able to begin working as a software engineer. So far I am fluent in C++, Python, and Java.
        I am currently working on PHP so that I can expand my knowledge into the Cyber Security world.
