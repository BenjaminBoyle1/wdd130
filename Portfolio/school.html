            <h4>Coronado Highschool</h4>
            <p>I graduated from Coronado High School in 2018 with a 4.0 gpa. 
                I was the president of Computer Science club and it was in Highschool 
                that I discovered my love for computers. I began taking Coding Academy 
                classes and mainly focused on Java.</p>

            <h2>College and Further Education</h2>
            <h4>Brigham Young University-Idaho</h4>
            <p>After graduating I immediately left on my mission to Honduras. After returning 
                home at the end of 2020 I began my studies at Brigham Young University Idaho. 
                I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Spanish. Whenever something 
                interests me I hyperfixate on learning everything I can and becoming the best 
                I can possibly be. This is especially true with programming. Since beginning my 
                studies I have taken countless online courses to give me an advantage in my courses 
                and to be able to start working as I further my education. In addition, I am preparing 
                for an internship this summer with LinkedIn, where I will be able to begin working as 
                a software engineer. So far I am fluent in C++, Python, and Java. I am currently working 
                on PHP so that I can expand my knowledge into the Cyber Security world.
